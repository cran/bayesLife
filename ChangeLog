0.4-0 (05/03/2012)
-----
Function for plotting joint distribution of female and male e0 added: e0.joint.plot.

Functions added that create graphs for all countries for female-male gaps and the female-male joint distribution:
e0.gap.plot.all, e0.joint.plot.all

Prediction of joint female-male e0 is invoked automatically from the e0.predict and e0.predict.extra functions 
(if the given mcmcs correspond to a female simulation).


0.3-2 (04/12/2012)
-----
Some defaults of run.e0.mcmc changed (e.g. start.year was set 1873).

Argument joint.male added to get.e0.prediction.

Added functions get.e0.jmale.prediction and has.e0.jmale.prediction.

Function e0.trajectories.plot can plot distribution for both sexes into one plot (argument both.sexes).

Example data reduced from 3x50/2 iterations to 2x60/2 iterations.

Functionality for overwriting country specific prior parameters added (argument country.overwrites in run.e0.mcmc and run.e0.mcmc.extra).

Arguments verbose.iter and constant.variance added to run.e0.mcmc.

e0.coda.mcmc.list renamed to e0.coda.list.mcmc to be consistent with bayesTFR's function coda.list.mcmc.

Some clean up of the experimental code.


0.3-1 (02/08/2012)
-----
The GoF.dl function renamed to e0.GoF.dl and its implementation was consolidated with tfr.GoF.dl in bayesTFR.

Arguments added to run.e0.mcmc for setting the lower and upper bounds of truncated normal prior distributions.

A few arguments added to e0.trajectories.plot.

New functionality for handling supplemental historical data implemented.

New functionality for joint prediction of female and male (Lalic et al) implemented.  

Some experimental functions added.

0.3-0 (11/17/2011)
-----
Performance improved in two ways:
1. MCMCs are converted to environments (instead of being lists), so that they are not copied every time.
2. A few functions implemented in C.

Function GoF.dl for computing goodness of fit added.

An argument 'predictive.distr' added to the e0.DLcurve.plot to plot predictive distribution of the DL function.

A bug in the e0.DLcurve.plot function fixed that made the quantile curves noisy.

0.2-1 (10/13/2011)
-----
A few internal modifications.

Function get.countries.table added.
	
0.2-0 (05/06/2011)
-----
Official UN WPP 2010 data added to the package and the default for argument wpp.year set to 2010.

Argument 'gender' renamed to 'sex'.

Feature of auto-simulation implemented in run.e0.mcmc.

Argument gender in run.e0.mcmc changed to c('Male', 'Female').

Feature of 'auto-simulation' added to run.e0.mcmc and continue.e0.mcmc.


0.1-1 (03/11/2011)
-----
Function e0.map.gvis added.

Method get.mcmc.meta put into NAMESPACE.

0.1-0 (01/19/2011)
-----
Initial CRAN version.
